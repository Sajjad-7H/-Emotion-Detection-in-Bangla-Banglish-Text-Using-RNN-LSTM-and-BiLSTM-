\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\subsubsection{Emotion Class Distribution}
The class frequencies show a skewed distribution. Approximately:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Joy: \(\sim 22\%\)
    \item Sadness: \(\sim 21\%\)
    \item Anger: \(\sim 18\%\)
    \item Fear: \(\sim 16\%\)
    \item Surprise: \(\sim 13\%\)
    \item Disgust: \(\sim 10\%\)
\end{itemize}

This imbalance explains why the models, especially LSTM Run~1, perform weakly on \textit{anger}, \textit{fear}, and \textit{disgust}, which receive less representation during training.
